# Laboratory of Biomass Chemistry and Morphology

Our group works with chemical and physical pretreatments for biomass
conversion, aiming applications in biofuels and biomaterials.
Pretreatment technologies are used to fractionate plant biomass
components, mainly cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, extractives and
inorganic particles, allowing their application into various products.
The research projects in this laboratory are dedicated to the use of
cellulose to produce biofuels or cellulose nanoparticles (nanocrystals
and nanofibers), to the use of plant extractives, and also lignin
characterization and applications. Due to the interdisciplinary
character of these research fields, students and researchers from
different areas are welcome!
