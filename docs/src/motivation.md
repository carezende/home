The uncertainties about the availability and the climate consequences of
petroleum indiscriminate use have encouraged the search for new sources
of clean and renewable energy, and also for eco-friendly feedstock to
obtain nanostructured materials and plastics.

Plant cell wall is one of the most abundant sources of renewable energy
and particles on earth, which can improve the global production of
biofuels and other biomaterials. Residues of leafs, stalks, barks,
bagasses, and others have been currently underutilized and their proper
use requires the fractionation of their components promoted by chemical,
physical and biological agents. Different strategies have been applied
for this purpose, including chemical methods, such as acids, bases and
solvents; physical methods, such as heat and milling; and biological
agents, such as enzymes and microorganisms.Â

The comprehension of the action mechanisms of these different agents on
the various cell wall types demands an integrated approach, combining
methods to determine the chemical composition of the samples undergoing
pretreatment steps, associated to microscopy techniques for
morphological determination. Our research projects also look for a
global use of the lignocellulosic sources, which have their components
separated and directed to appropriate applications. The optimized use of
the feedstock, decreasing the amount of residues and maximizing the
useful products is a more sustainable and economically viable way to
valorise the biomass sources.
